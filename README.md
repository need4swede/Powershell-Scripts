# Useful Powershell Scripts

Some powershell scripts that I've made that can be useful to automate certain tasks within Windows. Some of these have GUI versions available, but most of them run within a terminal. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Copy of Windows (32-bit/64-bit) with Powershell

## List of Scripts

### ' Filename Manager '

* Add a prefix to the name of a batch of files of a given filetype within a chosen directory
* Add a suffix to the name of a batch of files of a given filetype within a chosen directory
* Remove any text from the name of a batch of files of a given filetype within a chosen directory
```
Run 'file manager.exe' for terminal version and file manager GUI.exe' for the GUI.
Note that only the terminal version will list all available file types within the chosen directory.
```

### TBD

* Work in Progress
