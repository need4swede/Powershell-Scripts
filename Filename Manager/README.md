# Filename Manager

PS script that lets you browse to a folder, list what filetypes (extensions) are found within that folder and allows you to ammend the filenames of all the files (of the selected filetype) within that folder. 

## Functions

* Windows Explorer file browser to choose a directory
* Print a list of all file extensions found within a chosen directory
* Add a prefix to file names
* Add a suffix to file names
* Remove text from file names

### Dependencies

* Copy of Windows (32-bit/64-bit) with Powershell

```
Currently, the GUI version does not print a list of extensions. 
You would have to know the extension of the files you want to alter when prompted. 
Use the non-GUI version if you want the list printed.
```
